# Data-Science-Project-on-Film-Dataset

## Introduction

**Author: Elliot H Wurst**

In this project, I began the process of cleaning the data from a film dataset compiled by [rashida048](https://github.com/rashida048) on GitHub. I will then analyze and visualize the data. The [dataset](https://github.com/rashida048/Datasets/blob/master/movie_dataset.csv) includes 4803 films across 24 columns of information, such as the film's production company, the film's budget, and the film's revenue.

The goal of this data science project is to understand the correlations between the different columns of data about the films. The questions I would like to answer by the end of this project include, but are not limited to:
- What is the average budget for films with certain keywords?
- Does higher popularity and a higher vote average directly correlate to a higher revenue?

Because there is no description for the data columns on the GitHub page, I compiled a list below that describes the columns:
- `index`: the film's position in the dataset
- `budget`: the film's estimated expenditures
- `genres`: the film's theatrical category, form, or style
- `homepage`: the film's website
- `id`: a unique number to identify the film
- `keywords`: common word associations with the film
- `original_language`: the language the film uses primarily
- `original_title`: the original name of the film
- `overview`: the film's description
- `popularity`: a numeric metric for depicting the overall popularity of the film, where the higher the number, the more popular the film
- `production_companies`: a list of companies that helped produce the film, which includes the companies name and unique id
- `production_countries`: a list of countries where production occurred, which includes the name of the country and its abbrevation
- `release_date`: the date that the film premiered in theaters
- `revenue`: the total amount income of the film
- `runtime`: the amount of time it takes to watch the film in minutes
- `spoken_languages`: a list of all the languages that are used in the film, which the native name of the language and an abbreviation of the language
- `status`: where the film is in its production cycle
- `tagline`: the film's slogan on posters and advertisements
- `title`: the current name of the film
- `vote_average`: the average of all rating votes
- `vote_count`: the number of rating votes counted
- `cast`: a list of the main cast members of the film
- `crew`: a list of all people who helped create the film, which includes the crew member's name, their gender stored as a number, their department, their job in the department, their credit id, and their unique id
- `director`: the name of the person who directed the film
